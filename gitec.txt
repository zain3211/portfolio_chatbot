As a Sensory & Consumer Science Data Scientist Intern in GITEC. Wissam took on projects that involved advanced multivariate statistics, survival analysis, ANOVA, NLP applications and correcting old Python scripts. 
For the first project at GITEC, Wissam was responsible for creating a landscaping tool using Microsoft Excel. The main statistical technique used behind the scenes was PCA. The tool served as a direction for the product team on how to improve their products. Wissam has never done any Excel VBA at the time and over the course of about two weeks, Wissam taught himself how to write macros. During the last week of his internship, he was assigned the same project on new data and it took him less than 24 hours to complete it.
For the second project at GITEC, Wissam developed a Python script and implemented survival analysis techniques to gain insights on the impact of physical attributes on the product’s shelf-life index and providing recommendations to the team. The library used for this project is called Lifelines. Additionally, Wissam provided a whole presentation deck from data cleaning to modelling as a standard reference for newcomers implement a survival analysis on GITEC’s data.
For the third project at GITEC, Wissam implemented statistical analysis on surveys aimed at understanding consumer perception between an internal product vs a competitor and presenting the results to the team.
For the last project at GITEC, Wissam applied NLP techniques to extract valuable insights from textual data in surveys, leading to actionable insights for management team. The library used for this task was Spacy.
