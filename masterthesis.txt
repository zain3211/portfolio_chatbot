This paper investigates the multiple aspects of effective speech-making, focusing on the roles of linguistic patterns, metaphors, emotional resonance, and narration to answer the ultimate research question: What Makes a Good Speech? 
The study seeks to understand the recipe for a successful speech by evaluating the rhetorical strategies and emotions employed by famous orators such as Winston Churchill and Martin Luther King Jr.  To understand the causes for their long-lasting impact, we examine linguistic structure, repetition, and phonetic appeal of speech. 
The linguistic and acoustic information to feed into a classifier model are extracted using the expanding disciplines of Natural Language Processing and Automatic Speech Recognition. Several features are extracted from text-based speeches which correspond to text readability, lexical richness, topic modeling, subjectivity and classic rhetoric detection. On the other hand, wave features are extracted from audio-based speeches which are then fed to two deep learning models, Multi Layer Perceptron and Convolutional Neural Network, to finally generate the emotions of the speaker. This exploratory technique aims to identify the key patterns and mechanisms that occur in high impact presentations. Results show that better classification outcome were obtained by combining both text-based and audio-based analytics. The thesis can be found under the projects tab along with the code repository.
